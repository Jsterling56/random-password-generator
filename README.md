# random-password-generator

This is a random password generator, start code was given to me from my Rutgers coding bootcamp.

I added Javascript functionality with the help of my tutor, Katie Redford.
This exercise helped me understand Javascript in a different way.

Thanks to my teachers - Rommel and Ringo, and all the people that helped me understand this material.
